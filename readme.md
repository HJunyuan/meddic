# Meddic - Augmenting the healthcare sector in Singapore
Quickly identify and provide critical patient information to first responders with facial recognition.

This web application was submitted as part of our team's attempt in the [HackNTU hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/meddic-jgd6hy).

## Inspiration

Our team was looking to make use of facial recognition technology to augment the healthcare sector in Singapore. Are we able to move away from identifying patients through a physical NRIC card? With the push of the smart nation initiative, we built Meddic to help clinics and hospitals to leverage image recognition technology, making it easy to identify patients and quickly obtain all their medical information.

## What it does

Using a simple application, nurses in clinics and hospitals can easily register patients to see doctors without the need for patients to carry along their NRIC card. Once registered, all medical details (i.e. pre-existing medical conditions, drug allergies, blood type etc.) are fetched from the database and made available to the doctors immediately.

First responders that attend to victims will also be able to take advantage of Meddic. With a simple scan, all pre-existing medical conditions, drug allergies and blood type will be displayed on the application. This allows doctors/nurses to quickly attend to patients with the necessary precautions as quickly as possible rather than looking for physical identification that the patient may not be holding at the time.

We believe this will help push the Smart nation initiative by removing the reliance on physical forms and NRIC for registration purposes. This would be used to send patients through faster processing and access to healthcare as efficiently as possible.
